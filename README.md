# First-Snowpack-App
Snowpack is a frontend build tool, replacement for Webpack. AMAZING number of templates available at [https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/create-snowpack-app/cli](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/create-snowpack-app/cli) and wider support than Vite with community templates as well.

> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.

### npm test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
